Let us bring you through the development of Project Scoop! 
## Design Process

Before we started, we first thought of the needs of every shoppers as well as compare the processes of shopping from the selection to the payment. We then sieve out interesting and useful features from other website and implemented it into our website. Of course, we studied the basis of the orginal website and found out which areas can be improved. 

As this is a consumer-focused website, customers should be able to complete their shopping process within a limited number of clicks and breakpoints. Satisfactory customers is our top priority as they will always return to this site to pruchase more products.

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
