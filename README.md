# Project Scoop - ID Assignment 2

Welcome to Project Scoop! 

Presenting to you an new ecommerce created for Scoop Wholefoods. This is a platform where you can view and purchase in-stock products of your choice as well as to earn rewards and discounts when you become a member. In addition to that, we have added new gamification features to provide all members a better shopping experince online while saving cost on purchases when they check out. 

Who are we? Scoop started off as an Australian based store founded by Jeremy and Bettina Kirk in 2013 with the mission to improve people's health and well-being while safeguarding the planet for future generations. Align with their mission, Scoop provides natural,  organic and affordable products which brings health and environmental benefits. Packages delivered to customers are made from biodegradable and recyclable materials. 

Why the creation of website? To enhance every shopper's experience, we made sure that every feature was well-thought of from the buttons to the colour choice. Generating a 'For You' section based on current purchases and selection is one of the many new features added. A game can be played by members to entice them to shop more as huge discounts are given to members when they check out. 

Let us bring you through the process of creation of Project Scoop!
 
## Design Process

Before we started, we first thought of the needs of every shoppers as well as compare the processes of shopping from the selection to the payment. We then sieve out interesting and useful features from other website and implemented it into our website. Of course, we studied the basis of the orginal website and found out which areas can be improved. 

As this is a consumer-focused website, customers should be able to complete their shopping process within a limited number of clicks and breakpoints. Satisfactory customers is our top priority as they will always return to this site to pruchase more products.

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
